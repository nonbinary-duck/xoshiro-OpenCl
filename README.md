# xoshiro-OpenCL

A simple C++ CMake project with the xoshiro256** pseudo-random number generator implemented as an OpenCL kernel.

The program also displays some noise generated by xoshiro256** using the OpenCV library.

## Compilation

In Linux cd to the project root and type `make`. This produces a binary file: `./build/release/xoshiro-opencl` and copies the kernels into that binary directory.

The `make` command here is used to execute `cmake`. Run `make --dry-run` to see what it does.

The problem with using `make` this way, however, is that no arguments are passed to the execution of the CMake generated Makefile. Therefore compiler flags are managed in the CMake file 

This project has launch and build configs for vscode([-dium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium)). So you can use the build menu (`ctrl+shift+b`) for a GUI experience.

### Dependencies

Requires OpenCL and optionally OpenCV (toggle the `#USE_OPENCV_STUFF` flag in the CMake file). If using OpenCV an image will print demonstrating the algorithm.

To install the dependencies, Aptitude can be used on debian and debian-derivative operating systems (e.g. Ubuntu and family).

There is an issue with my Ubuntu-derivative system and OpenCV where `/usr/include/opencv4/opencv2/...` headers include `#include "opencv2/<stuff>.hpp"` which GCC doesn't like. To fix this I used a symbolic link (i.e. `/usr/include/opencv2`).

The OpenCL SDK can also be compiled from source quite easily! See [Khronos Group's OpenCL Guide](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Guide/blob/main/chapters/getting_started_linux.md) for more details.
